  <h1>
      My childhood's dreams
  </h1>

  <h3>
    <i>
      I had ambitions!

  </h3>
    <p>
    As a child, I had two great ambitions that I want to be when becoming an adult. It was about 
    electrical engeneering and playing piano. 
    In other words, I wanted to be an electrician and an expert piano player.

      It was funny!

    I have a younger brother. We were quite like-minded at that time.
    My mather always bought electrical device for us like radio, phones,... 
    What we did was trying to break the device and redo it later. Most of the time we could not 
    fix it as it was before anymore. As a result,we were always told off by our mother.
    However, this did not stop her to buy what she really needed at home but 
    we still kept breaking what we got.
    Eventually, she  gave up!

    I had to improve my electrical skill, so I gathered many devices through 
    lookig for them in the bins or buying from my friends.
    My skill was boosted, then I started to fix broken radios or torches in my village
    at the age of 13 with my brother without normally getting paid for about 3 years.

      What is more?

    When I went to church every Sunday, the piano players at church really inspired me.
    I was always asking my mother to send me to a school musical but she could not afford that, 
    so I didn't. What I did was, I invented my own piano made by pieces of wood and cords.
    Unfortunately, it did not look and sound as a piano. Just for playing.
