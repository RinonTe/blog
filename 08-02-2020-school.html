    I started studying in 2005 by entering in a kindegarten in a private school next to my village.
    In fact, I did not go there to study but to play with other kids.
    I had my older sister who was studying in the school where I went to.
    She always finished class at 10am at get back at 2pm. So when went home at 
    10, I followed her too.

    I started going to the primary school at the age of 7. I had finished 5 years there,
    I went on to study in secondary school for 4 years. During these 4 years, I 
    had to help my parents to pay for my scholar fees.
    Nohing much to tell about my time there because everything went smoothly.
    The great opportunity for me is beeing able to study in high school and I got my 
    baccalaureat degree in 2016.

    Unfortunately, My way was blocked because I could not keep going anymore.
    So, what I could do was looking for jobs (but chasing the wind) and helping my 
    parents to take care of my two younger siblings.
