    It had been raining a lot during the whole previous night. As a result, there were a lot of damages in the city
    where I am, which is in Mahanoro.<br>
    <em>
      The city was in the water!

  <h2>
    <i>
      Big flood!
    </i>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Up to now, there is a lot of water everywhere!<br>
    This is what was seen in Catholic church in Mahanoro last Sunday.

    Some people could hardly step out because their houses were surrounded by water. The roads became rivers too.

    Finding the boats in the sea
  </h3>
  <p>
    Because of the strong wind on Saturday, a few boats had been brought away from their places.<br>
    It was kind of a hard work to look for them in the ocean because some of the were found far away from Mahanoro.<br>
