      Experiencing a different culture

        As Mahanoro is one of the

          Betsimisaraka

        cities, the culture is a bit
        different from other tribes.

    <h3>
      What makes it so unique?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Apart from their interesting language,
      there are several customs and traditions that the local people 
      maintain and are really strict about.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Let's take some exemples:
    </h4>
    <p>
    Most people here never use the real table when eating becaus that is what they
    used to be. Instead, they use mats and everyone sits around the 
    mats when the meal-time is coming.
    It is kind of taboo or rude to step on the mat even unintentionally.

    <p>
      Among some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsimisaraka_people">
      Betsimisaraka</a> it is considered fady for a brother to shake hands with his sister, or for young men to wear shoes during their father's lifetime.<br>
      <strong>However, it is no longer common in Mahanoro.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Among many
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsimisaraka_people">
          Betsimisaraka
        </a>, 
      the eel is considered sacred. It is forbidden to touch, fish or eat eel. Although many coastal Malagasy communities have a fady against the consumption of pork, this is not universal or common among the Betsimisaraka, who often keep pigs in their villages.

    <h3>
        Traditional ceremonies
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Betsimisaraka practice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famadihana">famadihana (reburial)</a> and sambatra (circumcision) and believe in sorcery and a wide range of supernatural forces. Many taboos and folktales revolve around lemurs and crocodiles, both of which are common throughout Betsimisaraka territory.
