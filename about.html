      I am called Rinon, 21 years old. I was born and raised in Vodiriana which is one of the
      small towns inside of Moramanga's ditrict (Madagascar). At the moment, I am settling in Mahanoro which is a city
      and rural commune
      located in the Atsinanana region of eastern Madagascar, along the coast.
      I have been living here for 13 months in order to look for a different life
      and study as well.
