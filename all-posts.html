          What makes my town important?

      <p>
        Generally, I would say that I come from Moramanga which is a city (commune urbaine) in Madagascar.
        It is located between the capital city Antananarivo and the east coast.
        The name Mora-manga literally means “cheap mangoes”, but it has nothing to do with mangoes.
        The city of Moramanga has an important place in the history of Madagascar.
        It was in Moramanga, on the night of the 29th of March 1947 that the Malagasy Uprising against French colonial
        rule started.
        Moramanga is also the capital city of the Bezanozano people (one of the eighteen Ethnic groups of Madagascar).
        Moramanga is in the Alaotra-Mangoro region...

    <p>
      As a child, I had two great ambitions that I want to be when becoming an adult. It was about
      electrical engeneering and playing piano.
      In other words, I wanted to be an electrician and an expert piano player...

      A life changing day
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two years after getting the baccalaureat degree, I got a call from ONJA NGO.
      It was surprising to me because I did not even know anything about it.
      It is an organisation which helps the students who don't have the opportunity to
      continue studying anymore after BEPC or BACC.I attended the first exam in my town, then
      I passed.A few months later, we went to Mahanoro to take part in the 2-week formation.
      There was an exam again and I took it.
