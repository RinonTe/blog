      Meeting up with a new friend
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the begining of this week, which was on Sunday, we met a new friend who is studying coding
      as well. He has just started his study but he already knows more about it. We came together to have
      some drinks and discussing about being a web developer iven if we are not there yet. It was a wonderfull
      afternoon.

    <p>
      He's now gone to the place where he wants to keep up studying while he is from Marolambo.

    <h2>
      Full of excitement:
    </h2>
    <p>
      We had always been excited to learn <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> when we were
      still studying <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> for a few weeks. This week,
      we met our ambition because we started covering it last Monday.
    </p>
    <h2>
      The new begining
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the begining, I found it rather ok, but I am strugling at the moment.
      Hopefully, it will turn out well soon because we have got a good teacher here to help us solve our
      difficulty. it is difficult!
    </p>
    <p>
      To be honest, we have a lot of fun when we are studying even if we always face problems.
      Probems help us learn and give us more experience.<br>
      <q>I think I like problems</q>
    </p>
    <h3>
      We made a common mistake!
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our teacher asked us to do some research yesterday but none of us completed it so he was really
      frustrated. As a result, he left us to do our task alone. Everyone was really strugling with the
      exercises.
