            It had been my longing to meet up with all friends and visit my relatives during the last holiday but by
            means of this pandemic, I could not fulfill my desire because our town was still locked-down.

            <em>
              Was it a big problem for me?
            </em><br>
            <i>No.</i>
            Not a problem at all!. We had such a great week-holiday here. A litle bit problem is that everyone is not
            relly allowed to go out because of the confinement and it is not only here but wherever we go, it is the
            same.

            On the fist two days, I had a difficulty in passig the time. It was kind of longer than usual because I did
            not have a lot of activity to do apart from reading a book, being on line which became boring if not altered
            with other things.
